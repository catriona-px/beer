Half Pint vs Full Pint: The Burning Question 

Ever wondered if the size of your beer glass affects how quickly your drink warms up? So did we. 
What's This Madness? 

A computational exploration into beer thermodynamics, because apparently, we have nothing better to do.

Features 

     🧊 Simulates beer temperature evolution
     👋 Accounts for hand temperature
     🌡️ Considers ambient air conditions
     📊 Compares half pints vs full pints
     
Our model considers: 

     Surface area to volume ratio
     Heat transfer coefficients
     Consumption rate variations
     Glass thermal conductivity

Key Parameters 

     Initial beer temperature
     Ambient temperature
     Hand temperature
 
What You'll Get 
A matplotlib plot showing: 

     Temperature evolution of half pint vs full pint
     Cumulative pints consumed
     Average temperatures

Disclaimer 
Science may have been harmed in the making of this project. Beer was definitely consumed.
